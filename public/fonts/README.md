# Fonts Configuration

This project uses **Google Fonts** as free alternatives to the original design fonts:

## Font Mapping

### Original → Google Fonts Alternative

1. **Soleil** → **Plus Jakarta Sans**
   - Light (300)
   - Regular (400)
   - Modern geometric sans-serif with clean lines
   - Great for body text and lighter elements

2. **Neue Haas Grotesk Display Pro** → **Inter**
   - Light (300) - replaces 45 Light
   - Medium (500) - replaces 65 Medium
   - Black (900) - replaces 95 Black
   - Described as "like twins" with Neue Haas Grotesk
   - Excellent for headers and emphasis

## Why These Alternatives?

- **100% Free** - No licensing costs or restrictions
- **Optimized for Web** - Both fonts are designed for digital screens
- **Actively Maintained** - Regular updates and improvements
- **Excellent Readability** - Professional quality for portfolio sites
- **Auto-optimized** - Next.js automatically optimizes Google Fonts

## No Font Files Needed

Since we're using Google Fonts through Next.js, no font files need to be added to this directory. The fonts are automatically fetched and optimized by Next.js during build time.
